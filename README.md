Virtual Pet

Lets be honest pets can be hard work. Well not no more, 
here is the virtual pet you can:

- Name it. const petName = new Pet("pet name")
- Feed it. petName.feed()
- Walk it. petName.walk()
- give it a birthday. petName.growUp()
- check up on it. petName.checkUp()
- but be warned if these things are not done, it may die!

This can all be done form the comfort of your sofa.
The challenge is to keep it alive for 30 days.
