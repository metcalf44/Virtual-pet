Virtual Pet

Lets be honest, pets can be hard work. 
Well no more, here is your new Virtual pet, you can:

- Name it.
- Feed it.
- Talk to it.
- Walk it.
- but be warned if its not looked after, it may die!

The best thing is, this can all be done form the comfort of your own sofa.
The challenge is to keep it alive for 30 days.
